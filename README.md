- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiffchantoneasy
- 👀 I’m interested in whatever it takes to make my skills accessible to others
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to digitise language transcription on a tone chart with customisable romanisation
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding the digitising of language transcription to enable people to speak languages they've not necessarily learned before! I know this is possible manually so it therefore must also be possible digitally. Please reach out if you can help!
- 📫 How to reach me: email tiff.chantoneasy@gmail.com
